# 📊 Student Risk Analyser Dashboard

A full-stack **Student Risk Analysis** web application leveraging an XGBoost machine learning model to predict student risk levels based on user input, with interactive data visualizations to support decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎯 **Risk Prediction with XGBoost:**
  Predict student risk categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High) using an XGBoost model trained on Kaggle student data.

* 📝 **Interactive Input Form:**
  User-friendly form built with React (MERN stack) to input student metrics and receive instant risk predictions.

* 🔗 **Flask REST API:**
  Backend API serving predictions and data visualizations using Python and Flask.

* 📊 **Dynamic Data Visualization:**
  Visualize risk breakdowns and metrics with Python-powered charts integrated into the dashboard.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Student-Risk-Analyser-Dashboard.git
cd Student-Risk-Analyser-Dashboard
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd client
npm install

# Backend
cd ../server
npm install

# Flask API
cd ../apiserver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run servers

Open separate terminals for each:

```bash
# React app
cd client
npm run dev

# Express backend
cd ../server
npm start

# Flask API
cd ../apiserver
python app.py
```

---

## 📋 Usage

* Open the React app in your browser ([http://localhost:5173])
* Fill out the student data form with relevant metrics (GPA, attendance, etc.)
* Submit to get risk predictions powered by the XGBoost model
* Explore risk visualizations to analyze student group trends

---

## 🔍 Model Details

* The XGBoost model was trained on a public Kaggle dataset related to student performance and risk factors.
* Features include grades, attendance, participation statistics, and more.
* Model files and training scripts are in the `/model` directory.
